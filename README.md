This is a RealPython tutorial for Django about user profiles. I have done here almost exactly what is in the tutorial.

What needs to be worked on:

* Handeling an improperly filled registration form.
* Making a page to allow changing user details, such as email. (Also allowing the email to be added after the init. of the account.)
